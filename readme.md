# Virtex Code Challenge

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Make sure that you are using Unreal 4.26.2 or above
* It's a more a code test so be sure that you have VisualStudio, Rider or NotePad++

### Getting project

Create a Fork of this project with your github account. If you don't have one or you want to just clone the project it's also fine, just remember to put it on WeTransfer or your GDrive afterwards. After finishing it, please share it with [Tomek](mailto:tomasz@virtexstadium.com)

## The Problem

We have a simple multiplayer project. At the moment movement does not work properly (offline and online), not everything is replicated from Pawn, I don't know why our PrintString in pawn blueprint does not work - help us find why.

## The Goal

The goal of this test is not to create the bestest multiplayer experience ever. Experience has to work in a multiplayer environment - that's all.
We really want to see your way of thinking and approaching the problem. There is no good or bad way to do it - there are many solutions for this challenge.

In project you will find:
* VTPawn C++ class
* VP_VTPawn Blueprint which parent class is VTPawn
* TestMap - this is a map where magic should happen
* Defined Inputs

## Requirements

Finished project has to run properly in Client mode with 2+ players in Editor. That's all.

## Bonuses

* If you can find a fun way to diversify projects, go for it! New class? New BP? New mechanics? TPP? Go for it!
* If your code is self explanatory, comments are not required.
* C++11 is welcome, however not required.
